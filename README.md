# Bhagbat-Gita-App-with-API

This project is about Bhagavad Gita. I used a [API](https://rapidapi.com/bhagavad-gita-bhagavad-gita-default/api/bhagavad-gita3) to fetch all the data shown in the website. You can click on the chapters to go inside to see the details of that chapter. You will also find all the verses of that chapter listing together. You can further click on them to see them in detail like, verse original text, word meaning, translations.
